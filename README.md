MNIST Multiview Datasets
========================

MNIST is a publicly available dataset consisting of 70, 000 images of handwritten digits distributed over
ten classes. We generated 2 four-view datasets where each view is a vector of R<sup>14 x 14</sup>:

* MNIST<sub>1</sub>:  It is generated by considering 4 quarters of image as 4 views. 
* MNIST<sub>2</sub>:  It is generated by  considering 4 overlapping views around the centre of images: this dataset brings redundancy between the views.
